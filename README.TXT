This is the Student Advising Transcript project. This project can be similar to the regular transcript of any university's portal website. Here, students can track their progress while studying at school. There is a menu with different fields of distribution. Students can easily track how many courses they have finished to know the next course they should take to complete their major or graduate. This version of the Student Advising Transcript is more advanced than usual, as students can find what they want in the menu bar. They don't have to search through many courses and waste their time.
